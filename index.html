Hello,

My name is Pujianto. I'm from Bekasi and graduated from Gunadarma University with Economic degree. I felt a little lost in life after graduation, and not knowing what to do in life. The thing I know for certain is that I want to be a web developer.
​
So now I am currently doing a study in Hacktiv8. I feel that I can learn more and get the skills necessary. This kinda hard for the first but I believe that I will be get it soon. I started my own blog here and I will post my progress and a little bit of what we do each day.
 
I would love to get more into techno blogging but I would also like to write about my experiences.
​
So, Welcome!
